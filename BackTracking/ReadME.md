# Backtracking Problems

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
