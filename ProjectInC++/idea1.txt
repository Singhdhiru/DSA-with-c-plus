Project: Inventory Management System

Description: The Inventory Management System is a program that can be used to keep track of inventory items for a business. The system will allow the user to add new items to the inventory, update the inventory when items are received or sold, and generate reports on the inventory status. The system will also allow the user to set a minimum quantity for each item, and generate an alert if the quantity falls below the minimum level.

Features:

    Add new items to the inventory with details like item name, description, quantity, price, etc.
    Update the inventory when items are received or sold.
    Set a minimum quantity for each item and generate an alert if the quantity falls below the minimum level.
    Generate reports on inventory status, including information on each item's name, description, quantity, price, and total value.
    Allow the user to search for items based on various criteria, such as item name, description, price, and quantity.

Tools and Technologies:

    C++ programming language
    Standard Template Library (STL)
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
    File handling in C++
    Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio or CodeBlocks.

The Inventory Management System project can help you improve your C++ programming skills while also learning about the fundamental concepts of inventory management. It can also be extended to include features like user authentication and a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
